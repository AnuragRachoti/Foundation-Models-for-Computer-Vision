# Foundation-Models-for-Computer-Vision
Advancing Camera based detection models for intelligent sensor infrastructure. 


Object detection, tracking and sensor data fusion are central system modules
The annotation of a diversified 3D object detection dataset is highly time-consuming
The solution: Maximize the utilization of open data sources and unsupervised data to generate a well performing pretrained network before adapting to a specific domain
